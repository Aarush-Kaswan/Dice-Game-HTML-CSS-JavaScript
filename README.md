In this game, both players roll dice one-by-one.
The sum of the numbers rolled is added until the palyer rolls 1.
As soon as a player rolls 1, another player gets to roll the dice and the current score of the initial player changes to 0.
To stop that from happening, the player could hold the current score and give the turn to the other player.
By this way, the first player could add his current score to the main score.
The first player to reach the score of 100, WINS.
